## Analysis of my running performance

The purpose of this notebook is to present analysis of my running performance and create a machine learning model which will be able to predict the average tempo ( seconds / kilometer ) when given the distance and elevation gain.<br><br>
The notebook consists of three main parts:<br><br>
<li>:white_check_mark: <b>Data wrangling</b>
  <ul> 
    where I clean the dataset and make it ready for further steps.
  </ul>
<li>:chart_with_upwards_trend: <b>Exploratory Data Analysis</b>
  <ul>
    where I take a deeper look into data and try to have a good overview on my activities.
    </ul>
</li>
<li>:clamp: <b>Building ML models</b>
  <ul>
    where I create three regression models in order to predict the average tempo of my potential runs. 
  </ul>
</li>
<br>
Data for my activities has been collected from Garmin watch, which I always use while doing sport activities. Thanks to Garmin Connect app I was able to extract it in the .CSV format.
